# Threaded Binary Tree
Goals: Understanding that half the space allocated in a binary search tree for pointer information is wasted. Practice creating our own class and prototype functions.

Design and implement Tree class which convert a binary search tree to a double threaded binary tree(successor and predecessor).

## Compile and Run:
If running for the first time, modify simplecompile.sh privacy permissions by running the following command: 
   
**_chmod 700 simplecompile.sh_**  
  
After running this command,  this script becomes executable. Simply run it using the following command:  
  
**_./simplecompile.sh_**  

For an input of size 10, the output should match the attached file: **output.txt **

## Work Distribution
Workload was evenly distribution between eachother. Debugging and coding on call while working on the project simultaneously using Repl.it
